# MorseCode-English-Translator

Description

Our project aims to deliver a software program that will run on a Raspberry Pi to receive a user input and translate it between English text and Morse code. This translation program will assist the user as an educational tool to learn Morse code and allow the user to communicate through Morse code without prior knowledge. This project will be achieved through the combination of software and hardware components, including the Raspberry Pi device that will be running the software. The project will be developed using the C++ programming language, given its efficiency and the resource constraints associated with the Raspberry Pi hardware. Furthermore, translation algorithms will be developed by our team. However, we also plan on integrating the OpenAI ChatGPT API into our program to allow users more advanced translations and provide an interactive aspect to give the users more informative responses to questions about Morse code. This integration requires an internet connection, which will be another hardware consideration to configure. Finally, a keyboard will be connected to the device in order for the user to input text to be translated, and we are considering an additional simple button to receive a user’s Morse code input to translate into English. 

Features

Required features: 
Translation from english to morse code, user will input english characters with a keyboard, and the resulting morse code will be output by the raspberry pi, using lights and/or sound
Translation from morse code to english, user will enter morse code through the keyboard (or potentially through a button on the raspberry pi), the translated english sentence will be displayed on the computer screen
Project will have both a hardware and software component, hardware component will be used for input/output of morse code, software component will be used for input/output of english characters

Optional features: 
As an optional input feature, we plan on elaborating input options using a button. This way, the user will be able to input using practical Morse code, and the system will return the appropriate output as mentioned above. This item has the potential to be a difficult feature as few team members have hardware or Raspberry Pi experience, and this feature requires the addition of an extra button.
As an optional backend feature, this project can be improved in efficiency with a GPT API call to translate the Morse code into plain text or vice-versa. This feature will require extensive prompt-engineering research and AI model understanding to determine which GPT version will be most efficient and accurate. There may also be a requirement to trim the given response depending on the context. 

Wish-list features:
Use OpenAI’s GPT API to generate a response to the message the user enters in morse or english.
User’s input can be in English or morse code. 
Output will be in morse: need accurate results → should the response be generated in morse or should the response be generated in english then translated to morse before it is outputted?
Might need to display the generated response in English on the computer for any user who does not know morse. 
Accuracy is a major risk with this feature → the method for translating english to morse and vice versa needs to be properly implemented for this feature.

Risks
Ensuring that all hardware components work seamlessly with the Raspberry Pi may pose compatibility challenges. Integrating with a GPT API may involve dealing with rate limits, API usage costs, and the challenge of understanding and crafting effective prompts for Morse code translation. Also, trimming the responses generated by the AI model to ensure they are concise and contextually relevant can be challenging. Data Accuracy is another critical aspect to consider. Ensuring that translations are accurate and reliable, especially for long or complex messages, is crucial. Finally, expanding the project scope beyond the initial requirements may lead to feature creep and make it challenging to deliver on time.
